Play with a 3D starship model in a web browser using Javascript

My work was a piece of a larger project where a basic space flight simulator was created
for a graphics class.  Instructions to run the project were provided by partner, Keith
McAfee, and are as follows:

Node.js version (from MS Windows):
	install https://nodejs.org/en/
	run Node.js command prompt
	navigate to folder where public_html is located
	install web server by typing "npm install http-server -g"
	run the web server by typing "http-server ." 
	open Google Chrome and navigate to localhost:8080
	click on the public_html link

For python:
